# Abstract
* 2% of moelcules can pass through the blood brain barrier
* Bayesian statistics and ML techniques are used to create a robust model against different chemical descriptor set combinations
* Overall accuracy is 95%
    * Accuracy of Positives is 83%
    * Accuracy of Negatives is 96%

# Introduction
* BBB is very selective about which molecules can pass through and this presents a problem in CNS drug development
* Most Pharma companies do not have a BBB drug targeting development program (2,3)
* BBB Penetration is taken into account in toxicology studies
* BBB measure is possible but expensive and time consuming
* Automatic prediction of BBB Penetration is a useful tool in drug discovery (13)
* A study claimed SVM provided better results than Neural Networks (19), i think otherwise, my report will investigate this.
* A descriptor set generated by shape signatures trained on linear regression models and SVMs provided better results (25), what are shape  
    signatures and which chem library can we use to generate this dataset?

* The dataset is very biased, bayesian models were used to unbias the dataset

# Estimating a Priori probabilities
* P(h+) = P(h-) is not valid as recent estimates claim only 2% of molecules can cross the BBB
* The Molar weight is an important attribute as smaller molecules with smaller weights cross the BBB easily than larger molecules
    - Also from the prior density probability chart, smaller molecules with smaller weights cross easily
    - What other factors are important asides from molar weights in deciding the BBB Penetration, use a random forest to investigate this
        and a prior density probability chart
