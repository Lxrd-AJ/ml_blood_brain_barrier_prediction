    * Datasets
    - Merc Data @Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity
    - Sample drugs @DrugBank http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB04845 and http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00441

* Machine learning in drug discovery and design: An Enhanced similarity score for predicting drug properties
    - Predicting the probability of a drug passing through the blood brain barrier
    - Evaluate NAMS for predicting similarity of drugs
    - Evaluate structural and semantic similarity techniques separately
    - Combine them to create a new similarity measure based on semantic (ontology) similarity and extending NAMS with it (X-NAMS),
        and implement it in the current version of NAMS
    - Evaluate the similarity score on NAMS and BBB dataset



* Machine Learning in Drug Discovery:
